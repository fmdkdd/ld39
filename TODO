@merwan:
- shadows are too strong (and too large?)

@fmdkdd:


UNASSIGNED:
- rotated solar panels are all black at night (minor, due to light direction)

Can fix AFTER deadline (don't prioritize):
(We can still fix bugs after the deadline, if they don't impact gameplay)
- weird particles bug that may be driver-specific (particles.mesh is displayed in the outline pass)


Post-rating features:
- add level name/number
- unify highlighting/tile hovering so that clicking on an object or
  its tile picks it up, and mouse hovering on the tile shows the coverage
- level transition sound
- make controls mobile-friendly
- make the solar panel animation pop more (almost blinking, but with a large cooldown)


DONE:
- level validation
- can go to next level
- validation for night levels
- battery distributePower
- fix models rotation (all models should face the same direction)
- adjust models scale
- duplicate next level button in night levels (and too small, too high)
- outline feedback on consumers (same effect)
- make rock grey (looks interactable as is)
- validate day and night separately (rules are different)
- adjust camera to see whole levels (maybe add camera data in level)
- add more levels
- visual feedback for POWERED battery (we forgot that!)
- sound effects
- background music
- holding the mouse on a wind turbine stops it from rotating
- rotating a thing resets all wind turbines motor rotation
- end screen?    (can use HTML on top of canvas)
- add explanations below the game
- title screen?  (can use HTML on top of canvas)
- visual polish (transitions)
- level complete sound
