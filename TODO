@merwan:
- shadows are too strong (and too large?)

@fmdkdd:
- level sound
-

UNASSIGNED:
- rotated solar panels are all black at night (minor, due to light direction)
- moon is in front of things in last level

Can fix AFTER deadline (don't prioritize):
(We can still fix bugs after the deadline, if they don't impact gameplay)
- looks like we have a large memory leak
- weird particles bug that may be driver-specific


DONE:
- level validation
- can go to next level
- validation for night levels
- battery distributePower
- fix models rotation (all models should face the same direction)
- adjust models scale
- duplicate next level button in night levels (and too small, too high)
- outline feedback on consumers (same effect)
- make rock grey (looks interactable as is)
- validate day and night separately (rules are different)
- adjust camera to see whole levels (maybe add camera data in level)
- add more levels
- visual feedback for POWERED battery (we forgot that!)
- sound effects
- background music
- holding the mouse on a wind turbine stops it from rotating
- rotating a thing resets all wind turbines motor rotation
- end screen?    (can use HTML on top of canvas)
- add explanations below the game
- title screen?  (can use HTML on top of canvas)
- visual polish (transitions)
