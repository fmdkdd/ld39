@merwan:
- shadows are too strong (and too large?)
- outline feedback on consumers (same effect)
- make rock grey (looks interactable as is)

@fmdkdd:
- validate day and night separately (rules are different)
- add more levels
- sound effects
- background music

- duplicate next level button in night levels (and too small, too high)

unassigned:
- adjust camera to see whole levels (maybe add camera data in level)
- title screen?
- visual polish (transitions)
- visual feedback for POWERED battery (we forgot that!)
- highlight is applied to particles (maybe removing the particles should fix it?)
- particles stay between levels


done:
- level validation
- can go to next level
- validation for night levels
- battery distributePower
- fix models rotation (all models should face the same direction)
- adjust models scale
