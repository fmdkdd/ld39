@merwan:
- fix models rotation (all models should face the same direction)
- obstacle model cannot be loaded
- poweredCells feedback (zones)
- solar panel model (texture?)
- adjust models scale
- fix turbine 'head' rotating (only the part connected to the blades should rotate)
- shadows are too strong (and too large?)

- show heldThing somewhere (under cursor?)
- outline feedback on consumers (same effect)

@fmdkdd:
- add more levels
- sound effects
- background music


unassigned:
- adjust camera to see whole levels (maybe add camera data in level)
- title screen?
- visual polish (transitions)
- random houses can overlap (depends on camera?)
- visual feedback for POWERED battery (we forgot that!)
- duplicate next level button in night levels (and too small, too high)


done:
- level validation
- can go to next level
- validation for night levels
- battery distributePower
